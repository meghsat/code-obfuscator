## What is the use of obfuscating code?? <br>
Obfuscation is the practice of making something difficult to understand.  Programming code is often obfuscated to protect intellectual property and prevent an attacker from reverse engineering a proprietary software program. Obfuscation may involve encrypting some or all of the code, stripping out potentially revealing metadata, renaming useful class and variable names to meaningless labels or adding unused or meaningless code to an application binary. A tool called an obfuscator can be used to automatically convert straight-forward source code into a program that works the same way, but is much harder to read and understand.
